## Welcome!

I'm Midka, here on github known as `kymppi`.

Recently I've been learning a lot more about cybersecurity and specifically about things related to authentication. For example I built my own authentication server [Kuura](https://github.com/kymppi/kuura) with a Secure Remote Password (SRP) implementation. Participated in the ECSC 2025 Qualifiers for Finland's team.

Right now my biggest focus is on [Minehub](https://minehub.live). It's a minecraft minigame network that has a backend written in golang instead of only using java. The benefits of using an external backend is the flexibility it provides. For example start/stop servers from an admin panel and database usage and migrations are handled centrally instead of in the gameservers. It's easily my biggest project ever.

Looking to build a new homeserver soon so I can reduce my dependencies on cloud services even more. Slowly moving over to more encrypted and decentralized social media. Going to migrate from Github at some point (for different reasons).

Do I use AI for programming? No. There are many great use cases for AI, like researching medicine and other scientific things. Programming, writing and artwork are not part of them.
